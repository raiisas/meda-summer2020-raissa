// The If Statement - Use it to ask questions

var number1 = 10;
var number2 = 15;

// Syntax
// if (conditional) { group of code to run if conditional is true}
// No ; if (number1 == number2) because the () is ending the statement for this section... Same for {}


// Conditional Operators
// == Compares two values, becomes the boolean true if it is the same, and false if they are not the same.
if (number1 == number2) {
    console.log("This if statement was true so I am this code!");
}

console.log ("Program Finished!");
