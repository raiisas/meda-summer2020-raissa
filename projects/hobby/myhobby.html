    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Rai and I’m a tech and web developer enthusiast. I currently reside in San Francisco, one of the largest technology hubs in the World. I enjoy integrating my education and performing arts background with interactive media. Here on this page, you’ll find a quick overview of one of my favorite hobbies - motion capture technology.</p>

    <h2>About My Hobby</h2>

    <p>If you’re interested in doing motion capturing on your computer, first you’ll need a couple of tools to get you started. Besides a computer and projector, you’ll need a device to capture your full body. Whereas the cameras on our computers are great at capturing our faces, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Kinect-Sensor-Dance-Central-Spotlight/dp/B00NMST9G8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=learniproces-20&linkId=81a2f9f85afb126460d1d39b2f50ff03">Kinect Sensor v2</a> has something called depth resolution to track your body as it goes near or far from the device. Then, I highly suggest you download a free application called, <a href="https://www.ni-mate.com/">NI mate</a>,  it gives your computer all kinds of data to help sync your movement in real time. Put it all together with Traikatronix’s GUI called <a href="https://troikatronix.com/get-it/">Isadora</a> in order to set the rules for how your motion will trigger your audiovisuals.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of a video I was working on in Isadora:</p>

    <h2>Additional Tips</h2>

    <p>Fingertip technology like the computer keyboard and touchpad are very fun to use. However, I feel that motion capture cameras and even wearable technology can be just as functional. In the theater world, interactive technology is being utilized to initiate scenes and special effects. Overall, I hope my experience with my hobby helps you to find your passion for technological advancement. </p>
